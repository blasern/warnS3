warnS3 is intended to give warnings when loading packages that overload S3 methods. Currently it offers the functions

* `warnS3Methods` Give a warning for masked S3 methods.
* `library2`, `require2` Same as base functions with additional warning for S3 methods. 

Extensions are planned for `::`, `loadNamespace`, `get0`, `:::` and possibly other functions.

warnS3 is not yet available on CRAN. You can download the latest development version from github with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("blasern/warnS3")
```
